A musical structure App

The structure of a music app using intents and empty activities.

The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app

Each activity is clearly labelled, using a TextView, such that the final purpose of such an activity is easy to understand.
The app contains 5 activities, each labelled, which work together to make a cohesive music app.

The app will play music from the user’s library of music? 

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal

Creating new activities

Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.

Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:

Text sizes are defined in sp
Lengths are defined in dp
Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
